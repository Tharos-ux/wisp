# Introduction

This document is designed for future contributors. I will state in it current advances in all classes, and where are located functions you might want to alter.

# Building of datasets

Inside `sample_class.py`, you will found functions to create sample objects, which will be a representation for a read. It will store its parameters and computations.
This class is also responsible for calling functions to generate datasets, and calling of functions to load genomes.
